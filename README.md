This project, developed as part of the "Statistical Data Analysis" course, focuses on analyzing NBA team statistics from the 1996-97 season. The analysis includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and two dimensionality reduction techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). 
Results are compared, visualized, and thoroughly discussed.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1. Descriptive statistics.
2. Variable correlations.
3. Data visualization (boxplots, scatter plots).

## PCA Analysis (Principal Component Analysis):
1. Bartlett's test and KMO measure to validate PCA applicability.
2. Dimensionality reduction and component selection (explaining >80% of variance).
3. Factor loadings and result interpretation.

## MDS Analysis (Multidimensional Scaling):
1. Classical MDS (STRESS = 0.13 – poor fit).
2. Sammon's Mapping (STRESS = 0.02 – very good fit).
3. Visualization and grouping of teams based on performance.

## Summary:
1. Strengths and weaknesses of PCA and MDS.
2. Comparison of results and interpretation of team relationships.
